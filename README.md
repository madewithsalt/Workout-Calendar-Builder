# How to use

This is a silly script I wrote to create a CSV file that's compatible with Google Calendar.

**Requirements**
- A terminal window
- Ruby


**Example Usage**
	$ ruby p90x-csv.rb "April 16, 2012", "7:30 AM", "classic"

It's a pretty stupid program. You have to use this order, and "classic" is the only thing supported right now.

#Adding the Calendar to Google

- MAKE A NEW CALENDAR. Seriously. You don't want to delete 90 individual entries if you messed up your CSV.
- Go to your calendar settings and select "Import Calendar"
- MAKE SURE YOU SELECT YOUR NEW CALENDAR. I warned you!


**Pull requests welcome!**
Eventually I'll make this into a cute little web-page, but until then its for the enjoyment of us hardcore nerds only. :)

I was too lazy to add doubles and leans, but it's ready to be added to the JSON.
